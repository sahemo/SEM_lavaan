### Notes                          ###
######################################
1. Missing values are labeled "999999".

2. Text order was counterbalanced depending on participant ID (despite appearing in only one order in the table).

3. There are some IDs missing in the sequence. These are no-shows or instances of equipment error. In the latter case, partial data of the participant was discarded completely and a replacement was scheduled to reach the target sample size of 180.

4. Replacement IDs are the ones > 180. (repl_ID = old_ID + 180; so ID 181 is a replacement for ID 1).
